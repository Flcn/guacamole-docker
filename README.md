About this Repository
=====================

This repository provides a Docker image for the
[guacamole-client](https://github.com/glyptodon/guacamole-client/) project, the
the web application portion of [Guacamole](http://guac-dev.org/) which serves
the JavaScript client to connected users, and functions as an authenticating
tunnel between the client and server.

Although intended to become the officially-maintained Docker image for the
guacamole-client portion of the [Guacamole project](http://guac-dev.org/), this
is our first adventure into the world of Docker, and is thus experimental. Once
it proves itself, this will be adopted within the Glyptodon repositories, and
become part of each Guacamole release, not to mention officially-documented.

Please report any bugs encountered by opening a new issue in the JIRA system
hosted at: http://glyptodon.org/jira/
